I would appreciate a note and link to https://github.com/tjluoma/ or http://luo.ma (my Web site) somewhere in the documentation for your version as a courtesy.

If you improve this in some way, especially if you find a way to do something quicker, more efficiently, or somehow "better" I would really like to know about it.

That is all.
